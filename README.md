# About
I am a third-year Computer Science Engineering major with a minor in Bioinformatics, driven by a strong motivation to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have a solid foundation in Python, Golang, R and other programming languages, along with advanced technologies like PyTorch, LangChain, and Microsoft Azure.
